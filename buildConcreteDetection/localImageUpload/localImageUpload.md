# Image Upload run Locally

1. Let us use `localhost:3000` to run the `imageupload` app.

2. Let us navigate to this directory from the root folder, to execute the shell script.

```
cd /imageUpload/local
```

```
sh runImageUploadLocally.sh
```
![Run Image Upload Locally](/docScreenshots/runLocalImageUpload.png)

![Dashboard of Image Upload Locally](/docScreenshots/localImageUpload.png)

3. By clicking the `upload` button, we can now upload images from our `local computer storage`.

## Thank you ... :)
