# Crack Detection run Locally

1. Let us run the `crackDetection` app locally at `localhost:5050`, but it won't produce any browser-generated pages. Check all folders for images (both proccessed & non-proccessed), let's see.

2. The folder structure on computer will appear as follows because we did not run the applicationüëáüèª.

3. Let us navigate to this directory from the root folder and execute the shell script.

```
cd /crackDetection/local
```

```
sh runCrackDetectionLocally.sh
```

4. We may notice that the folder(/completed Dir added) structure has changed a bit and the pictures have been processed.
